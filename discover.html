			I chose the University of Minnesota Duluth because it felt like the perfect balance between academic opportunity and natural beauty. When I first visited campus, I was struck by how welcoming everyone was—from the professors who genuinely care about student success to the small class sizes that make it easy to connect with classmates.

			One of my favorite things about Duluth is its location along Lake Superior; there’s nothing like walking along the lakewalk after class or watching the ships come into the harbor. I especially love spending time at “The Rocks” by Lake Superior, where students often gather to relax, take photos, or just enjoy the view.

			In the fall, the scenery is breathtaking—the mix of colorful leaves against the deep blue water makes it one of the most peaceful and beautiful spots in the city. I’ve also enjoyed exploring local areas like Canal Park, Enger Tower, and the nearby hiking trails in Gooseberry Falls and Jay Cooke State Park.
		</p>
		<p>
			The city has a strong sense of community and adventure, which makes it easy to feel at home while still being inspired to explore. Overall, UMD’s beautiful campus, friendly atmosphere, and connection to nature make it an incredible place to study and grow.
